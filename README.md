# AutoCV

AutoCV is an automated cross-validation framework designed to simplify and streamline the process of cross-validation in machine learning projects. It aims to reduce the manual effort involved in evaluating machine learning models by providing an easy-to-use interface and a set of tools that automate various cross-validation tasks.

## Features

- **Automated Cross-Validation**: Automates the process of performing cross-validation for different models and datasets.
- **Support for Multiple Model Types**: Compatible with various types of machine learning models.
- **Default Performance Metrics**: Provides built-in performance metrics for evaluating models.
- **Extensible Framework**: Easily extendable with custom metrics and validation techniques.

## Installation

To install AutoCV, clone the repository and run the setup script:

```sh
git clone https://github.com/0xkerem/AutoCV.git
cd AutoCV
pip install -e .
```

## Usage

Here's a brief example of how to use AutoCV with a `LogisticRegression` model:

```python
from autocv import AutoCV
import numpy as np
from sklearn.linear_model import LogisticRegression

# Example dataset
X = np.random.rand(100, 10)  # 100 samples, 10 features
y = np.random.randint(0, 2, 100)  # Binary target variable

# Initialize the AutoCV object with a LogisticRegression model
model = LogisticRegression()
autocv = AutoCV(model=model)

# Perform cross-validation
results = autocv.cross_validate(X, y)
print(results)
```
